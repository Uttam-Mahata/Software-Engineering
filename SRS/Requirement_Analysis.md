# Requirement Engineering
**1. Inception (or Requirements Discovery/Identification)**

*   **Definition:** Inception is the initial phase where the need for a new system or product is recognized and its potential purpose is roughly defined. It's about understanding the "why" before diving into the "what" or "how."

*   **Key Activities:**

    *   **Problem Definition:**  Identifying the business problem, opportunity, or unmet need that the system will address.  This involves asking questions like: What are the pain points?  What inefficiencies exist?  What are the strategic goals?  What market opportunity is being targeted?
    *   **Stakeholder Identification:** Identifying all individuals, groups, or organizations who have an interest in the system or will be affected by it.  This includes users, customers, developers, managers, regulatory bodies, and even competitors.  Understanding their roles and influence is crucial.
    *   **Feasibility Studies:**  Conducting preliminary assessments of technical, economic, operational, and schedule feasibility.  Can we realistically build this system given our resources and constraints?  Is it cost-effective?  Can we deliver it in a reasonable timeframe?
    *   **Scope Definition (High-Level):** Establishing the initial boundaries of the project.  What will be included in the system, and what will be explicitly excluded?  This helps to prevent scope creep later on.
    *   **Establishing Project Goals:**  Defining the overarching goals of the project. This might involve improving efficiency by X%, increasing customer satisfaction, or reducing operational costs.
    *   **Initial Risk Assessment:** Identifying potential risks that could impact the project's success, such as technical challenges, resource constraints, or stakeholder conflicts.

*   **Example:** A company is losing market share because its customer service response times are too slow. The inception phase would involve identifying that problem, talking to customer service representatives and customers to understand the pain points, assessing whether a new customer support system is feasible, and broadly defining what the system should achieve (e.g., faster response times, improved customer satisfaction).

**2. Elicitation (or Requirements Gathering)**

*   **Definition:** Elicitation is the process of discovering, uncovering, and gathering requirements from stakeholders.  It's about understanding the specific needs, expectations, and constraints related to the system.

*   **Key Activities:**

    *   **Choosing Elicitation Techniques:** Selecting the most appropriate methods for gathering requirements from different stakeholders.  Common techniques include:
        *   **Interviews:**  Structured or unstructured conversations with stakeholders to gather detailed information.
        *   **Workshops:**  Facilitated sessions where stakeholders collaborate to define and prioritize requirements.
        *   **Questionnaires/Surveys:**  Gathering data from a large group of stakeholders using standardized questions.
        *   **Brainstorming:**  Generating a large number of ideas and requirements in a free-flowing environment.
        *   **Document Analysis:**  Reviewing existing documents (e.g., business plans, process documents, user manuals) to identify relevant requirements.
        *   **Prototyping:**  Creating preliminary versions of the system to get feedback from stakeholders.
        *   **Observation:**  Observing users in their natural environment to understand how they currently perform tasks and identify potential areas for improvement.
        *   **Use Cases:**  Developing scenarios that describe how users will interact with the system to achieve specific goals.
    *   **Conducting Elicitation Sessions:**  Planning and facilitating elicitation sessions, ensuring that all relevant stakeholders are involved and that the sessions are productive.
    *   **Documenting Elicited Requirements:**  Carefully recording all the information gathered during elicitation sessions in a clear and consistent manner.  This includes functional requirements (what the system should do), non-functional requirements (quality attributes like performance, security, usability), constraints (limitations on the system's design or implementation), and assumptions (factors that are believed to be true).
    *   **Managing Stakeholder Expectations:**  Communicating with stakeholders throughout the elicitation process, managing their expectations, and ensuring that they are aware of the progress being made.
    *   **Prioritization:** Working with stakeholders to identify the most important and critical requirements. This can involve using techniques like MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) or ranking requirements based on their business value and implementation cost.

*   **Example:**  In the customer support system example, elicitation would involve interviewing customer service agents to understand their current workflow, observing them using the existing system, holding workshops with managers to discuss desired system features, and creating prototypes of the user interface to get feedback on usability.

**3. Elaboration (or Analysis)**

*   **Definition:** Elaboration is the process of refining and expanding the initially gathered requirements to create a more complete, detailed, and consistent understanding of the system's functionality. It's about filling in the gaps, resolving ambiguities, and making sure the requirements are testable.

*   **Key Activities:**

    *   **Refining Requirements:** Taking the raw, elicited requirements and transforming them into well-defined, unambiguous statements.  This involves clarifying vague terms, adding details, and ensuring that each requirement is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
    *   **Modeling Requirements:** Using various modeling techniques (e.g., UML diagrams, data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze the system's structure and behavior.  This helps to identify inconsistencies and gaps in the requirements.
    *   **Creating Use Cases and Scenarios:** Developing detailed use cases and scenarios that describe how users will interact with the system in different situations.  This helps to ensure that all possible user interactions are considered.
    *   **Defining Data Requirements:** Identifying the data that the system will need to store, manage, and process.  This involves defining data structures, relationships, and constraints.
    *   **Analyzing Non-Functional Requirements:** Defining and refining non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, usability, reliability, and maintainability.  These requirements are often expressed in quantifiable terms (e.g., "The system shall respond to a user request within 2 seconds").
    *   **Identifying Constraints and Assumptions:**  Documenting any constraints that will limit the design or implementation of the system (e.g., budget constraints, technology limitations, regulatory requirements).  Also documenting any assumptions that are being made about the system or its environment.

*   **Example:**  In the customer support system, elaboration would involve taking the initial requirements and creating detailed use cases for tasks like "Create a new support ticket," "Search for a customer," and "Escalate a ticket to a supervisor."  It would also involve defining the data that needs to be stored for each customer and ticket, and specifying the performance requirements (e.g., "The system shall be able to handle 100 concurrent users").

**4. Negotiation (or Conflict Resolution)**

*   **Definition:** Negotiation involves resolving conflicts and disagreements among stakeholders regarding requirements. Different stakeholders often have conflicting needs or priorities, and negotiation is necessary to reach a consensus on the final set of requirements.

*   **Key Activities:**

    *   **Identifying Conflicting Requirements:** Identifying requirements that are inconsistent, contradictory, or mutually exclusive.
    *   **Prioritizing Requirements:**  Working with stakeholders to prioritize requirements based on their business value, technical feasibility, and cost.  This can involve using techniques like MoSCoW or AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process).
    *   **Exploring Trade-offs:**  Discussing the potential trade-offs between different requirements.  For example, increasing the system's performance might require sacrificing some usability.
    *   **Compromising and Finding Solutions:**  Working with stakeholders to find mutually acceptable solutions that address their concerns while still meeting the project's goals.  This might involve modifying requirements, adding new requirements, or removing existing requirements.
    *   **Documenting Agreements:**  Clearly documenting all agreements reached during the negotiation process. This ensures that all stakeholders are on the same page and that there is a clear record of the decisions that were made.
    *   **Escalating Issues:**  Escalating unresolved conflicts to higher levels of management for resolution.

*   **Example:**  In the customer support system, the sales team might want the system to track customer purchase history to help them upsell products, while the privacy team might have concerns about storing too much customer data. Negotiation would involve finding a compromise that allows the sales team to access some purchase history information while still protecting customer privacy.

**5. Specification (or Documentation)**

*   **Definition:** Specification is the process of formally documenting the agreed-upon requirements in a structured and organized manner. The resulting document, often called a "Requirements Specification Document" or "Software Requirements Specification (SRS)," serves as the blueprint for the system's development.

*   **Key Activities:**

    *   **Choosing a Specification Format:** Selecting the appropriate format for the requirements specification document.  Common formats include:
        *   **Structured Natural Language:**  Writing requirements in clear, concise, and unambiguous natural language, using a predefined template.
        *   **Formal Specification Languages:**  Using mathematical notation or formal languages to define requirements precisely.
        *   **Graphical Models:**  Using diagrams and models (e.g., UML diagrams) to visualize and represent requirements.
    *   **Organizing Requirements:**  Organizing requirements into logical categories, such as functional requirements, non-functional requirements, data requirements, and interface requirements.
    *   **Writing Clear and Concise Requirements:**  Writing requirements in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner, avoiding jargon and technical terms that stakeholders might not understand.
    *   **Ensuring Consistency and Completeness:**  Ensuring that the requirements specification document is consistent, complete, and free of errors.
    *   **Maintaining Traceability:**  Establishing traceability links between requirements and other project artifacts, such as design documents, test cases, and code.  This makes it easier to track the impact of changes to requirements.
    *   **Managing the Requirements Specification Document:**  Using a requirements management tool to store, manage, and track requirements.

*   **Example:**  In the customer support system, the specification phase would involve creating a detailed SRS document that includes all the functional requirements (e.g., "The system shall allow users to create new support tickets"), non-functional requirements (e.g., "The system shall respond to a user request within 2 seconds"), data requirements (e.g., "The system shall store customer name, email address, and phone number"), and interface requirements (e.g., "The system shall integrate with the existing CRM system").

**6. Validation (or Verification)**

*   **Definition:** Validation is the process of ensuring that the requirements specification document accurately reflects the needs and expectations of the stakeholders. It's about answering the question: "Are we building the right system?"  Verification, closely related, ensures that the requirements are complete, consistent, and correct. It asks: "Are we building the system right?"

*   **Key Activities:**

    *   **Reviewing the Requirements Specification Document:**  Having stakeholders review the requirements specification document to ensure that it accurately reflects their needs and expectations.
    *   **Performing Inspections:**  Conducting formal inspections of the requirements specification document to identify errors, inconsistencies, and omissions.
    *   **Creating Prototypes:**  Developing prototypes of the system to allow stakeholders to evaluate the requirements in a concrete way.
    *   **Developing Test Cases:**  Creating test cases based on the requirements specification document to verify that the system meets the specified requirements.
    *   **Conducting User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Having users test the system to ensure that it meets their needs and expectations.
    *   **Analyzing Feedback:**  Analyzing feedback from stakeholders and users to identify areas where the requirements need to be improved.

*   **Example:**  In the customer support system, validation would involve having customer service agents review the SRS document to ensure that it accurately describes their workflow and needs. It would also involve developing a prototype of the system and having agents use it to provide feedback on the usability of the interface and the functionality of the system. UAT would be performed before launch to ensure the system meets real-world user needs.

**7. Management (or Requirements Change Management)**

*   **Definition:** Requirements Management encompasses all activities related to controlling, tracking, and managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle. Because requirements inevitably change as stakeholders learn more and the project evolves, this is a critical and ongoing process.

*   **Key Activities:**

    *   **Establishing a Change Management Process:**  Defining a formal process for managing changes to requirements, including how changes will be requested, evaluated, approved, and implemented.
    *   **Using a Requirements Management Tool:**  Using a requirements management tool to store, manage, and track requirements, and to track changes to requirements over time.
    *   **Controlling Changes to Requirements:**  Carefully evaluating all proposed changes to requirements to assess their impact on the project's scope, schedule, and cost.
    *   **Maintaining Traceability:**  Ensuring that all changes to requirements are traced back to their source and that the impact of the changes is clearly understood.
    *   **Communicating Changes to Stakeholders:**  Communicating changes to requirements to all stakeholders, ensuring that they are aware of the impact of the changes on their work.
    *   **Version Control:** Maintaining different versions of the requirements specification document.

*   **Example:**  In the customer support system, a new regulation might require the system to collect additional customer data. Requirements management would involve documenting this change request, evaluating its impact on the system's design and implementation, and communicating the change to all stakeholders. The SRS would be updated, and traceability links would be updated to reflect the new regulation.

**In Summary:**

These seven tasks are the cornerstone of effective Requirements Engineering. By diligently executing these tasks, project teams can increase the likelihood of delivering systems that meet the needs of stakeholders, stay within budget, and are delivered on time. Remember that the specific implementation of each task will vary depending on the project's size, complexity, and the development methodology being used.
