# Types of Software Maintenance

Software maintenance refers to the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or adapt the product to a changed environment. There are four primary types of software maintenance:

1. **Corrective Maintenance**
   - Focuses on fixing bugs and errors discovered after deployment
   - Addresses software crashes, calculation errors, and unexpected behaviors
   - Often reactive and conducted in response to user reports

2. **Adaptive Maintenance**
   - Modifies software to function properly in a changing environment
   - Examples include updating software for new operating systems, hardware, or regulatory requirements
   - Necessary to keep software viable as external factors evolve

3. **Perfective Maintenance**
   - Enhances existing functions and adds new features
   - Improves performance, maintainability, or other quality attributes
   - Often driven by user feedback or competitive pressure

4. **Preventive Maintenance**
   - Identifies and corrects latent faults before they become operational problems
   - Includes code refactoring, documentation updates, and optimization
   - Proactive approach to reduce future maintenance costs

Each type serves a different purpose but collectively ensures software remains functional, relevant, and valuable throughout its lifecycle.
