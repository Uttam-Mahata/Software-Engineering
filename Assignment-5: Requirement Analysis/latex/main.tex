\section{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a detailed description of the requirements for the Bus Scheduling and Booking System. It outlines the functionalities, constraints, and objectives of the system to be developed.

\section{Document Conventions}
This document follows the IEEE 830-1998 standard for Software Requirements Specifications. The following conventions are used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requirements are uniquely identified using the format REQ-XXX-YY where XXX represents the module and YY is a sequential number.
    \item Priorities are classified as Critical, High, Medium, or Low.
    \item Use cases are documented using standard UML notation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Scope}
The Bus Scheduling and Booking System aims to automate and streamline the process of bus schedule management, ticket booking, and related operations. The system will serve various stakeholders including customers, booking clerks, supervisors, and managers.
